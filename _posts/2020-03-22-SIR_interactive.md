As a follow up to this series of posts, I've created a version of the model
that you can experiment with on your own, without needing to know any computer
programming.  [Try it here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ketch/covid-blog-posts/master?filepath=Interactive_SIR_model.ipynb).

Note that it may take some time for the model to load.

If you arrived here and haven't already read the series of posts on this
topic, I recommend that you [start at the beginning](http://www.davidketcheson.info/2020/03/17/SIR_model.html).
